Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.\"But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple?\"When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,\" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character.It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up.And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook.While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views.\"I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,\" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment.Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. \"I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused.\"Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe.\"Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,\" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character.But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden.\"Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,\" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea.At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media.He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon.But the hype did not stop there.Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own.Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own.There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.What a time to be alive.</td>\n",

McIlroy carded a third straight five under-par 67 to move to 15 under par with Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. The world number three's round included an eagle on the 12th as he bids to win his first title since May. \"The 67s I've shot this week have all been a little different and I feel like I've played within myself for all of them, \" said four-time major winner McIlroy of Northern Ireland. \"I feel there's a low round out there for me and hopefully it's tomorrow.\" McIlroy was level par for the day after 10 holes, dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and 10th, the latter mistake prompting the 26-year-old to throw his putter at his bag. But he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet. The former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July, ruling him out of several tournaments. But he returned in time to unsuccessfully defend his US PGA title at Whistling Straits in August and played in three of the FedEx Cup play-off events before starting the new PGA Tour season with a tie for 26th in the Frys.com Open in California.

       "      <td>Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer \"concrete solutions\". \"We want someone who can speak for the royal family,\" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. \"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. \"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. \"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. \"These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.\"</td>\n",

It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. \"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. \"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.\" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: \"I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.\" Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: \"Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him. \"Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person.\" David Thomas from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London added: \"He always said I want the music to speak for itself because it can, it's good enough, it willâ€¦ a very pleasant and lovely man.\"</td>\n",

This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. \"There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. \"We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others.\" Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: \"Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. \"Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. \"Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%.\" The number of homicide victims for 2014-15 stood at 59 last year but later increased to 62, after three cases were reclassified following deaths.</td>\n",

Other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients. ` pregnancy, ill health and the elderly may need more support,' she said. And menstruating women may benefit from adding oils ( evening primrose oil ) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate pms symptoms ( ms flowers recommends magnesium citrate ).

The agreement requires that manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to manuel's home from the des moines register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A lamoni address listed on the yelp page for manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While maneul has received just three patient survey responses on healthgrades. Com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction.

But there was one notable absence from the patriots squad who visited on thursday, with quarterback tom brady nowhere to be seen. However, a spokesman for the patriots said `prior family commitments' were the reason why brady didn't attend the visit. Scroll down for video. President barack obama ( centre ) welcomed the new england patriots to the white house on thursday. Patriots beat seattle seahawks 28 - 24 to win super bowl xlix in february and were congratulated by obama. But there was one notable absence with quarterback tom brady nowhere to be seen at the white house. The patriots beat seattle seahawks 28 - 24 to win the nfl super bowl in glendale, arizona with brady named as mvp for the third time in his fourth super bowl victory. Although brady wasn't able to visit the white house with his team - mates, he'll be fondly remembered for his performance in the patriots' super bowl win. He joins the likes of joe montana and terry bradshaw on four rings, and is now the all - time leader with 12 super bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37. It was also his record sixth appearance in the nfl's seasonal showpiece. A spokesman for the patriots said `prior family commitments' was the reason why brady didn't attend the visit.

She lived in a buddhist monastery, helped rebuild a sea wall in fiji, then went to india and worked with nepalese refugees. There, she met a young girl who wanted to find her family in nepal. Doyne went with her. That's when doyne's life took an unexpected turn. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015. A decade - long civil war had just ended in the country, and doyne witnessed its effects firsthand. She met women and children who were suffering, struggling to survive. ` `it changed me,'' said doyne, now 28. ` `there were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed, pick up a big stone and break it into little, little pieces ( to sell ). And they were doing that all day, every day.' ' doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $ 5, 000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in surkhet, a district in western nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the kopila valley children's home. Today, kopila - - which means `` flower bud'' in nepali - - is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the blinknow foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its kopila valley school, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in nepal year - round, traveling to the u. S. A few times a year. See more cnn heroes.

       "      <td>A g4s security van has been robbed outside a branch of royal bank of scotland in glasgow city centre. Police said three armed men took a five-figure sum from the vehicle in the city's sauchiehall street on monday at about 21:45. A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken. The area around the bank, which is near the buchanan galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police. Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of â£50,000. Following the robbery, the three men got into a white seat leon car, which sped off along west nile street towards the cowcaddens area. The car has since been found in scott street, near stow college. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination. Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on west nile street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery. Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them. The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities. Det insp alasdair barlow said: \"we are reviewing cctv images in and around the city centre. \"we would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car, in particular the cyclist. \"as the car left the scene, it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed.\"</td>\n",

It will be first celebrated on 31 may in 2017 with celebrations and events run by historic england. The date was decided upon after a poll involving 1,000 londoners. It was closely followed by 5 september - the date of the great fire of london. The yougov questionnaire also declared the houses of parliament as the building that best sums up london. People voted for the queen as their favourite historic london hero for the moment she secretly joined the crowds to celebrate victory in europe day. The results of the poll were released to mark the launch of historic england's \"keep it london\" campaign. People were asked to select a date to celebrate the capital's history, their historic hero and the building that sums up london. Big ben's first day in operation was 31 may 1859. The campaign is intended to encourage londoners to notice, celebrate and speak up for the heritage of their city, historic england said. The public body has also launched a film entitled i am london, which celebrates the historic buildings and places that have borne witness to the capital's history. Duncan wilson, chief executive of historic england, said: \"our heritage is a source of pride, a reminder of the city's past, a foundation for its present and the building blocks for its future.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>India finished the opening day of the final test against south africa on 231-7 - the highest score of the series. Neither side had amassed more than 215 in an innings in the previous three tests and india, who lead 2-0, were struggling on 66-3 and 139-6 in delhi. But ajinkya rahane hit 89 not out in half-century partnerships with virat kohli (44) and ravindra jadeja (24). Recalled fast bowler kyle abbott (3-23) and spinner dane piedt (4-101) were the only south african wicket takers. Piedt, 25, playing just his second test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with rahane was ended in bizarre fashion. The india captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into temba bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper dane vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took india beyond 200. Rahane was helped by jadeja, whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart dean elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of abbott. South african abbott, who had earlier bowled cheteshwar pujara and wriddhiman saha, conceded just 23 runs in 17 overs to continue his push to start the four-test series against england, which begins on 26 december in durban.</td>\n",

The 29-year-old terminated his contract with the o's after the transfer window closed, and cannot join another efl side until january. \"i wouldn't say i'm in a predicament, but i have never been in this position before,\" cox told bbc radio london. \"it is not a nice thing for a footballer. I'm not able to do my job.\" The former brighton man continued: \"i am going to have to sit it out again for four months before i can kick a ball in the league again. \"i'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done.\" Cox left orient on 1 september after turning down a move to league one northampton town. Having spent six years with the o's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, cox said he was \"an emotional wreck\" on his departure from brisbane road. \"i didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, i felt like i had no choice,\" he said. \"we had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons. \"it is a club i will always love. When i finish playing i want to be a manager and if i can go back there and manage one day that would be great.\" Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an efl club which will commence in january before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness. \"i was just getting back in the groove,\" he said. \"if i can get something sorted sooner rather than later league-wise, then great. \"hopefully the clubs i speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as i need to play. \"come january, i need to be ready to kick on.\" Cox has already held initial negotiations with league two side crawley town. \"it interests me because they are local to where i am,\" he said. \"it ticks the boxes and i used to play with the captain jimmy smith at orient. The manager [dermot drummy] wants attractive attacking football, which is great for me because that is the way i like to play. \"by no means is it a done deal.

       "      <td>A man, who downloaded thousands of images of children being sexually abused, has been released on probation. Edward alexander lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at belfast crown court on wednesday. Judge gordon kerr qc said it was the best way of protecting society and helping lee to change his ways. Lee, originally from whitehall square, belfast, but now living in england, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography. The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being \"loving and normal young man\". Judge kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his \"own strange pleasure\", they were serious matters as \"children were abused for these images to be made\". He added that children would continue to be abused while people like lee continued to view such material, and that \"society would not tolerate such behaviour\". Judge kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor simon jenkins said that when police went to lee's then belfast home on 5 june, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which lee admitted creating. During interview, lee said that he had been downloading images \"for perhaps the last nine years\". Defence lawyer taylor campbell said that lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.</td>\n",

McIlroy carded a third straight five under-par 67 to move to 15 under par with Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. The world number three's round included an eagle on the 12th as he bids to win his first title since May. \"The 67s I've shot this week have all been a little different and I feel like I've played within myself for all of them, \" said four-time major winner McIlroy of Northern Ireland. \"I feel there's a low round out there for me and hopefully it's tomorrow.\" McIlroy was level par for the day after 10 holes, dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and 10th, the latter mistake prompting the 26-year-old to throw his putter at his bag. But he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet. The former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July, ruling him out of several tournaments. But he returned in time to unsuccessfully defend his US PGA title at Whistling Straits in August and played in three of the FedEx Cup play-off events before starting the new PGA Tour season with a tie for 26th in the Frys.com Open in California. He is targeting a third Race to Dubai title in four years and leads England's Danny Willett by 271, 214 points with three events remaining after the Turkish Open. English pair Chris Wood (-13) and Richard Bland (-12) who were tied for second overnight are fifth and seventh respectively.   \n",
       "21  Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer \"concrete solutions\". \"We want someone who can speak for the royal family,\" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. \"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. \"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. \"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. \"These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.\"   \n",

It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. \"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. \"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.\" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: \"I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.\" Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: \"Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him. \"Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person.\" David Thomas from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London added: \"He always said I want the music to speak for itself because it can, it's good enough, it willâ€¦ a very pleasant and lovely man.\"   \n",

This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. \"There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. \"We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others.\" Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: \"Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. \"Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. \"Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%.\" The number of homicide victims for 2014-15 stood at 59 last year but later increased to 62, after three cases were reclassified following deaths.   \n",

Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games. \"It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence,\" Howe told BBC Radio Solent. \"We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games.\" He continued: \"A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take.\" Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal. \"We've had enough chances to win three games today,\" Howe added. \"Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key.\"   \n",

Not according to nutritionist and author sarah flower, who says that cooking with the right ingredients should give you all the goodness you need. ` the cleaner your diet - using fresh ingredients and cooking at home - the less likely you are to need to rely on supplements to boost your health.' She told mailonline. Scroll down for video. It's time to ditch vitamin pills for a diet rich in clean, fresh and unprocessed foods, says sarah flower. ` the typical western diet is heavily processed and sugar ridden,' explains sarah, `this makes us more susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.' And while it may seem like common sense to eat more unprocessed and raw foods, ms flower believes we are still not doing enough. ` we are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients.' She continued.' A diet rich in oily fish, whole grains, lean protein, fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients,' she said. Other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients. ` pregnancy, ill health and the elderly may need more support,' she said.

Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction : a chiropractor in iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on healthgrades. Com. The agreement requires that manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to manuel's home from the des moines register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A lamoni address listed on the yelp page for manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While maneul has received just three patient survey responses on healthgrades. Com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction. Strange practice : charles manuel, who admitted wrongdoing to the iowa board of chiropractic, listed his practice's addresses on this residential street in the small agricultural town of lamoni in southern iowa.   \n",

She lived in a buddhist monastery, helped rebuild a sea wall in fiji, then went to india and worked with nepalese refugees. There, she met a young girl who wanted to find her family in nepal. Doyne went with her. That's when doyne's life took an unexpected turn. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015. A decade - long civil war had just ended in the country, and doyne witnessed its effects firsthand. She met women and children who were suffering, struggling to survive. ` `it changed me,'' said doyne, now 28. ` `there were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed, pick up a big stone and break it into little, little pieces ( to sell ). And they were doing that all day, every day.' ' doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $ 5, 000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in surkhet, a district in western nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the kopila valley children's home. Today, kopila - - which means `` flower bud'' in nepali - - is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the blinknow foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its kopila valley school, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in nepal year - round, traveling to the u. S. A few times a year. See more cnn heroes. The cnn heroes team traveled to surkhet and talked to doyne about her work and the community she supports. Below   \n",

Police said three armed men took a five-figure sum from the vehicle in the city's sauchiehall street on monday at about 21:45. A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken. The area around the bank, which is near the buchanan galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police. Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of â£50,000. Following the robbery, the three men got into a white seat leon car, which sped off along west nile street towards the cowcaddens area. The car has since been found in scott street, near stow college. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination. Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on west nile street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery. Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them. The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities. Det insp alasdair barlow said: \"we are reviewing cctv images in and around the city centre. \"we would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car, in particular the cyclist. \"as the car left the scene, it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed.\"   \n",

It will be first celebrated on 31 may in 2017 with celebrations and events run by historic england. The date was decided upon after a poll involving 1,000 londoners. It was closely followed by 5 september - the date of the great fire of london. The yougov questionnaire also declared the houses of parliament as the building that best sums up london. People voted for the queen as their favourite historic london hero for the moment she secretly joined the crowds to celebrate victory in europe day. The results of the poll were released to mark the launch of historic england's \"keep it london\" campaign. People were asked to select a date to celebrate the capital's history, their historic hero and the building that sums up london. Big ben's first day in operation was 31 may 1859. The campaign is intended to encourage londoners to notice, celebrate and speak up for the heritage of their city, historic england said. The public body has also launched a film entitled i am london, which celebrates the historic buildings and places that have borne witness to the capital's history. Duncan wilson, chief executive of historic england, said: \"our heritage is a source of pride, a reminder of the city's past, a foundation for its present and the building blocks for its future.\"   \n",

Neither side had amassed more than 215 in an innings in the previous three tests and india, who lead 2-0, were struggling on 66-3 and 139-6 in delhi. But ajinkya rahane hit 89 not out in half-century partnerships with virat kohli (44) and ravindra jadeja (24). Recalled fast bowler kyle abbott (3-23) and spinner dane piedt (4-101) were the only south african wicket takers. Piedt, 25, playing just his second test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with rahane was ended in bizarre fashion. The india captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into temba bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper dane vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took india beyond 200. Rahane was helped by jadeja, whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart dean elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of abbott. South african abbott, who had earlier bowled cheteshwar pujara and wriddhiman saha, conceded just 23 runs in 17 overs to continue his push to start the four-test series against england, which begins on 26 december in durban.   \n",

The 29-year-old terminated his contract with the o's after the transfer window closed, and cannot join another efl side until january. \"i wouldn't say i'm in a predicament, but i have never been in this position before,\" cox told bbc radio london. \"it is not a nice thing for a footballer. I'm not able to do my job.\" The former brighton man continued: \"i am going to have to sit it out again for four months before i can kick a ball in the league again. \"i'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done.\" Cox left orient on 1 september after turning down a move to league one northampton town. Having spent six years with the o's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, cox said he was \"an emotional wreck\" on his departure from brisbane road. \"i didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, i felt like i had no choice,\" he said. \"we had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons. \"it is a club i will always love. When i finish playing i want to be a manager and if i can go back there and manage one day that would be great.\" Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an efl club which will commence in january before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness. \"i was just getting back in the groove,\" he said. \"if i can get something sorted sooner rather than later league-wise, then great. \"hopefully the clubs i speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as i need to play. \"come january, i need to be ready to kick on.\" Cox has already held initial negotiations with league two side crawley town. \"it interests me because they are local to where i am,\" he said. \"it ticks the boxes and i used to play with the captain jimmy smith at orient. The manager [dermot drummy] wants attractive attacking football, which is great for me because that is the way i like to play. \"by no means is it a done deal. We have had talks and we'll see how that goes.\" You can hear an interview with dean cox on bbc radio london's saturday sport show, which begins at 13:00 bst.   \n",

Edward alexander lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at belfast crown court on wednesday. Judge gordon kerr qc said it was the best way of protecting society and helping lee to change his ways. Lee, originally from whitehall square, belfast, but now living in england, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography. The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being \"loving and normal young man\". Judge kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his \"own strange pleasure\", they were serious matters as \"children were abused for these images to be made\". He added that children would continue to be abused while people like lee continued to view such material, and that \"society would not tolerate such behaviour\". Judge kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor simon jenkins said that when police went to lee's then belfast home on 5 june, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which lee admitted creating. During interview, lee said that he had been downloading images \"for perhaps the last nine years\". Defence lawyer taylor campbell said that lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.   \n",
